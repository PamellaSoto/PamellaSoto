I'm a developer who believes that great code is more than just functionality — **it’s thoughtful, organized, accessible, and made with purpose.**
With over **two years of hands-on experience**, I’m driven by a genuine passion for being able to create **well-structured, user-centered projects.**

Currently studying Full-Stack Web Development *(Sistemas para Internet)* at Faculdade de Tecnologia Rubens Lara, where I’m learning how to lead projects, manage deliveries within deadlines, and collaborate effectively with developers from all backgrounds. My academic and practical journey has taken me through projects of every level — from simple landing pages to complex systems.


Outside of coding, I recharge by watching series, reading short novels, and spending time with the people I love. I’m always open to learning, building, and connecting — **let’s create something remarkable together.**

## 📚 Currently improving myself on:

- Object-Oriented Programming (JavaScript)  
- Node.js and React Native
- Mobile-first responsive web design

I’m constantly pushing myself to grow and deliver the best results possible.
