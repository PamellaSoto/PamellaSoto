![Pamella Soto Cover](pamella-soto.jpg)

I'm a developer who believes that great code is more than just functionality ‚Äî **it‚Äôs thoughtful, organized, accessible, and made with purpose.**
With over **two years of hands-on experience**, I‚Äôm driven by a genuine passion for being able to create **well-structured, user-centered projects.**

Currently studying Full-Stack Web Development *(Sistemas para Internet)* at Faculdade de Tecnologia Rubens Lara, where I‚Äôm learning how to lead projects, manage deliveries within deadlines, and collaborate effectively with developers from all backgrounds. My academic and practical journey has taken me through projects of every level ‚Äî from simple landing pages to complex systems.


Outside of coding, I recharge by watching series, reading short novels, and spending time with the people I love. I‚Äôm always open to learning, building, and connecting ‚Äî **let‚Äôs create something remarkable together.**

## üìö Currently improving myself on:

- Object-Oriented Programming (JavaScript)  
- Node.js and React Native
- Mobile-first responsive web design

I‚Äôm constantly pushing myself to grow and deliver the best results possible.
